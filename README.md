# Lulu-Engine

Welcome to Lulu! A 3D rendering engine for easily creating a beautiful 3D scene. This engine focuses on food rendering, and it can help you manage your fridge, recipes, or diet with decent performance on Windows.

## Why

There are a lot of mature graphics engines for people to select for 3D rendering, but many of them have relatively high learning costs and many redundant features that are not critical for food rendering. So that is the main reason why I want to make a graphics engine of my own. Besides, Lulu is also a good learning project for me to have a better understanding of rendering pipelines and graphics programming.
